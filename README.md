# Currency-Converter
This is an implementation of a react app that converts between two currencies. For this example, I will use bitcoin and the kenya shilling.

## How to use these files?

1. Clone this repository and Open `currency-converter` folder in VSCode
2. Navigate to `currency-converter` in the terminal
3. Run `npm install` to install all dependencies
4. Run `npm run dev` to start the dev server
5. Visit `http://localhost:8080` in the browser

You should see a demo with one side the kenya shillings and one side the equivalent bitcoins according to a fixed exchange rate
