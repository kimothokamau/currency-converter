# Currency-Converter
This is an implementation of a react app that converts between two currencies. For this example, I will use bitcoin and kenya shilling.

## How to use these files?

Each folder is a new project, you will need to repeat this process for all 3 projects.

1. Open `01-Start` folder in VSCode
2. Navigate to `01-Start` in the terminal
3. Run `npm install` to install all dependencies
4. Run `npm run dev` to start the dev server
5. Visit `http://localhost:8080` in the browser
